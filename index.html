    <h2>294 schools lie above Herd Immunity</h2>
    <p>Across the 778 elementary schools in Oklahoma with vaccination records or exemption records on File only 294 have a vaccination rate high enough for herd immunity: the vaccination rate needed to protect those who are immunocompromised from diseases such as measles, mumps, and rubella. This includes only <span class="highlight private_hl" onclick="showPrivate()">33 percent of private schools</span> in the state. Oklahoma City school district, one of the largest school districts in the state has <span class="highlight OKCity_hl" onclick="showOKCity()">20 of its 54</span> elementary schools within herd immunity range and Tulsa (second largest) only has <span class="highlight TULSA_hl" onclick="showTulsa()">7 of its 50</span> Elementary schools at 95 percent or higher.</p>

  <h2>92 schools lies below 80 percent<br/>
      and 6 below 50 percent</h2>
    <p>The recent measles outbreak in New York and the increase in whooping cough within Oklahoma in 2016 were reported to take place within tight knit communities. A similar pattern can be seen within the schools that fall below the 80 percent vaccination rate. The median class size doe the 80 percent and below range  is around 38.5 students compared to the the state median of 55 students. Often lack of vaccination is due to exemption, Oklahoma allows for medical, religious, or personal exemptions according to the Oklahoma Health Department, but at least <span class="highlight exempt_hl" onclick="no_exempion()">49 schools</span> below the 80% mark had zero exemptions.</p>
